== Installation ==

Installation via WordPress Dashboard:

1. Navigate to Plugins->Add New
2. Search for "Social Media" and click "Install Now"
3. Once you have installed the plugin to configure your links and special effects etc.. look under Appearance -> Social Media Options
4. Go to your widgets and add the "Social Media" widget to your sidebar.

Installation via FTP

1. Upload 'social-media-wp' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin in the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Dashboard
3. Click "Settings" once you have installed the plugin to configure your social network links.


**Admin Options:**

Once you are in the admin panel the first thing to do is place the complete URLs to your profile pages in the box beside whichever sites you wish to display an icon for. (Any URLs left blank will not display an icon.)

**CSS style for your icons:** This option allows you to custom style the css for the wrapping div of the icons. ex: text-align: center; (that will center the icons in the widget)

**Icon Size:** 16, 24, 32, 48, 64 this is the size of the icons that will be displayed in the widget.

**Special Effects:** 

	* None - No Special Effect.
	* Dog Ear - This creates a dog ear effect on mouse-over (this effect only works if the background color of the widget is white).
	* Enlarge - The Icons appear to become larger on mouse-over.
	* Shrink - The Icons appear to shrink on mouse-over (You must set the background color of the widget below for this to work properly).
	* Shift Up - The Icons move upward on mouse-over (You must set the background color of the widget below for this to work properly).
	* Highlight - When you mouse-over the icons the border lights up around the icon (You must set the highlight color below for this to work properly).
	* Rotate - The Icons rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise on mouse-over (You must set the rotate degree below for this to work properly).
	* Bullseye - The Icons have a red bullseye appear on them on mouse-over.

**Rotate:** Set the degree that you wish the icons to rotate on mouse-over.

**Background color of widget in hex:** You must set this to the actual hex background color value of the widget for the shrink and shift effects to render correctly.

**Color to use for Highlight:** Set this to the color that you wish the border to become for the highlight effect.

**Hover Text:** Set this to create the text you wish to display when the mouse hovers over the icons. ex: Follow us on, Connect with us on, etc... (The Site name is automatically added to the text you enter here).

**Hover Text for RSS:** This is the hover text that is displayed if you choose to display an RSS feed icon. ex: Subscribe to our Feed

**Open Link in:** Either open the links in the same window or a new window.
